# Setting up the shop structure

## Setting up our views

+   we want to add to our views so we will group them in sub folders of the views folder
+   admin - contains all admin related pages such as add-products
+   shop - contains all customer facing pages

+   Setup all routes and controllers to suit new templates - this requires some refactoring of the code, for example we will split the controllers up into folders 1 for admin and 1 for shop. The routes will have to adjust the path of the imports to match these changes.

## Adding some fields to the form

+   We want to get some more data into our project so we add some more fields to our models properties.
+   Next add the form elements to the add-product page.
